# Tank Game
Tank Game based off of "Wii Play Tanks" game, made for 2 people. Spring Break Project over my Senior year in High School when I was taking AP Computer Science & learning Java.

## How To Run
Download Repo, then cd into bin, then run `java TankGamePlayer`. I never figured out how jar files work so you need to be cd'ed into the directory for the program to be able to find the media and image files.

## Rules
Move around the map, use power ups, health packs, and bullets to take down the opponent! Use walls to ricochet your bullets, along with portal guns for a surprise ambushes and attacks. Customize the game by disabling upgrades or healthpacks and create our own map!
